Route and guidance instructions are shown again and are correct. However, the ETA has changed from\u00a021:49 to 22:07? See 1236_FB2RbacktoCS_ETA2207.png.\n\nWe deviate again by ignoring the U-turn. Still the ETA is 22:07.\nSuddenly the NMB shows '0m to Robocharge' as if we had arrived at CS, but only for a fraction of a second. See: 1236_NMBshowsArrivalAtCSIncorrect.png\n\nAt this point, the location indication in the NMB disappears (only shows turn and distance info) and the ETA drops to 21:40 (??). See: 1236_NMBEmpty_ETAdropped27mins.png\n\n\u00a0Then we get presented with a new route, but the ETA is now back up to 22:02, see:1236_NewRoute_ETA2202.png\n\nOne second later, the ETA is updated to 22:06? Traffic harmonization maybe??\nRoute gets automatically updated due to \"current travel situation\". ETA changes to 21:50?? See: 1236_RouteUpdateDueToTravelSituation_ETAdropped 26mins.png\n\nSee ~2min video for more details (on ETF): ETAandBRP.mp4\n\n[EXPECTATION]\n\nI cannot explain all the jumps in ETA and weird route update behavior. I would expect the tour plan to remain more constant when only making minor deviation in the vicinity of a CS. Such deviations should trigger FB2Rs and not cause route updates of ~25 min difference in ETA.\n\n[HEALING]\n\nN/A\u00a0\n\n[CONTACT]\nfrank.spierings@tomtom.com\nmatthijs.koot@tomtom.com\nttdrivetesting",

Route and guidance instructions are shown again and are correct. However, the ETA has changed from\u00a021:49 to 22:07? See 1236_FB2RbacktoCS_ETA2207.png.\n\nWe deviate again by ignoring the U-turn. Still the ETA is 22:07.\nSuddenly the NMB shows '0m to Robocharge' as if we had arrived at CS, but only for a fraction of a second. See: 1236_NMBshowsArrivalAtCSIncorrect.png\n\nAt this point, the location indication in the NMB disappears (only shows turn and distance info) and the ETA drops to 21:40 (??). See: 1236_NMBEmpty_ETAdropped27mins.png\n\n\u00a0Then we get presented with a new route, but the ETA is now back up to 22:02, see:1236_NewRoute_ETA2202.png\n\nOne second later, the ETA is updated to 22:06? Traffic harmonization maybe??\nRoute gets automatically updated due to \"current travel situation\". ETA changes to 21:50?? See: 1236_RouteUpdateDueToTravelSituation_ETAdropped 26mins.png\n\nSee ~2min video for more details (on ETF): ETAandBRP.mp4\n\n[EXPECTATION]\n\nI cannot explain all the jumps in ETA and weird route update behavior. I would expect the tour plan to remain more constant when only making minor deviation in the vicinity of a CS. Such deviations should trigger FB2Rs and not cause route updates of ~25 min difference in ETA.\n\n[HEALING]\n\nN/A\u00a0\n\n[CONTACT]\nfrank.spierings@tomtom.com\nmatthijs.koot@tomtom.com\nttdrivetesting",

BE8, DRG (Dynamic Route Guidance) automatic, Alternatives off, EVTP (Electrical Vehicle Trip Planner) on (default), EV (Electric Vehicle) mocked through OBD2.\n\n**Observation:**  \nThe initial route was planned at 13:30.

The route between the first and second charging stop was unrealistic, taking almost 5 hours for 167km. The arrival SoC at the charging station did not change despite deviations from the route. At 15:45, the SoC was ~50%, making it impossible to arrive with 27% SoC. The routing did not calculate alternatives and kept directing back to Stuttgart. After charging at a CS (Charging Station) from 16:32 - 17:02, the route did not update the current SoC until 17:08, after which the ETA dropped significantly.\n\n**Expectation:**  \nETA should always be realistic.
