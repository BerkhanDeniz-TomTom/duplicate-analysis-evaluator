After this, we observe that the ETA for the next stop-over is very unrealistic: it is showing an ETA of ~22:36. A more realistic ETA at that time is ~20:32.\n\nWe continue to follow the route. At 15:00, the ETA has increased to 23:44 at the next stop-over.\nImage: 1500ETA.jpg\nImage: 1500ChargePlan.jpg\n\nAccording to this, the route between the first and second charging stop would take almost 5 hours while covering 167km on the highway/autobahn. This is of-course completely unrealistic.\n\nThe issue remains apparent until at least 15:45, where the ETA increased up to 02:09 at the stop and 03:03. While doing so, we also deviated from the route (to drive Stuttgart - Karlsruhe - Mannheim instead of the suggested Stuttgart - Heilbronn - Mannheim), and we noticed that the arrival SoC at the CS in the route plan didn't change. At 15:45, our SoC was ~50% (46.25kWh), traveling 163km to the charger would make it impossible to arrive with 27% SoC.\n\nAdditionally, the routing didn't calculate a different alternative and kept routing us back to Stuttgart to take the Heilbronn - Mannheim route.\nImage: 1545ChargePlan.jpg\n\nRoute goes over Karlsruhe after many deviations at 15:57, with a much faster ETA at the first CS. The travel time between the first and second CS is still faulty.\nImage: 1557ChargePlan.jpg\n\nFrom 16:32 - 17:02, we charge at a CS earlier than suggested in the route planning. After leaving the CS. The route does not immediately get updated with the current SoC: the arrival SoC at the next CS in 27km is still set to 27% even tough we charged up to 80%. At 17:08, the new SoC suddenly gets in to the route. From this point onward, the ETA also drops massively.\u00a0Before the update the ETA was 3:31 at the first stop. After the update, the ETA was 20:57 (= 6hr34 faster).\u00a0\n\n[EXPECTATION]\nETA should always be realistic\nArrival SoC should be updating when the charge or route changes\nRoute should be updating to a more optimal path after multiple deviations.\n\n[HEALING]\nAt 17:08, the new SoC suddenly gets in to the route.

Settings include BE8, DRG automatic, Alternatives off, EVTP on, and EV mocked through OBD2.\n\n**Observation:** \n- Initial route planned at 13:30. \n- At ~14:29, after reaching Flughafen Stuttgart, the ETA for the next stop-over is shown as ~22:36, while a realistic ETA should be ~20:32. \n- By 15:00, the ETA increases to 23:44, indicating an unrealistic travel time of almost 5 hours for 167 km.\n- Arrival SoC does not change despite traveling 163 km, making it impossible to arrive at the next charging station with the projected SoC.\n- Routing fails to adapt to deviations, continuously directing back to the original route.\n- After charging from 16:32 to 17:02, the system does not update the SoC until 17:08, at which point the ETA drops significantly.\n\n**Expectation:** \n- ETA should always reflect realistic travel times.\n- Arrival SoC should update with changes in charging or route.\n- The routing system should adapt to provide a more optimal path after deviations.\n\n**Healing:** At 17:08, the system finally updates the SoC, resulting in a significant reduction in ETA from 3:31 to 20:57, indicating a 6-hour and 34-minute improvement.\n\n**Note:** Logs for the relevant 2.5 hours have been added to the ticket"
