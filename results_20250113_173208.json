Attempts to change settings (e.g., DRG to semi-dynamic, SoC target to 15%, Alternatives to OFF) do not resolve the issue. The planner repeatedly suggests the Tesla Supercharger at Eindhovenseweg Weert, which is deleted multiple times. Even when at the FastNed Groote Bleek CS, the planner ignores it and suggests a CS on the opposite side of the highway.\n\n**Expectation:** The FastNed Groote Bleek CS is a more optimal choice, located just a few kilometers ahead on the highway.\n\n**Healing:** The specific CS (FastNed Groote Bleek) appears to be disregarded by the online EV route planner, with the issue occurring only once for this particular charging stop. \n\n**Attachments:** Full logs and cut traces are available for further analysis.",

The yellow mark in Lane D shows where a lane merge is happening - we penalise this option since being in a merging lane is inconvenient for the driver. More importantly though, driving from E to X, if you change lanes before the yellow section you need to change lanes twice, whereas if you wait until after the yellow section you only need to change lanes once. So we prefer the second option. Whereas driving from D to V it makes sense to change before the yellow section, in order to perform three single-lane changes instead of changing multiple lanes at once. This leads to the recommended lanes highlighted in cyan, with a gap between them. This is why it\u2019s expected to have a gap in recommendations in some situations.\"",

With the current input we always see that a lane is either completely recommended or not recommended at all.\n * E.g.:\u00a0\n * \u00a0 \u00a0 mapped_lane_groups {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 lane_group_id: 2343617233834542945\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 lanes {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 profile {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 flags: 1\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 }\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 }\n\u00a0 \u00a0 }\n * This profile says that the first lane of the mentioned lane group is completely recommended.\u00a0\n * This may be valid but we see this for each and every lanegroup in each and every scenario. It seems quite unrealistic that a recommendation of one lane will never change its status within a laneGroup. This would e.g. look like this:\n * \u00a0 \u00a0 mapped_lane_groups {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 lane_group_id: 2343617233834542945\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 lanes {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 profile {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 flags: 1\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 flags: 0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 length_cm: 1000\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 }\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 }\n\u00a0 \u00a0 }\n * This means that the first lane of the mentioned laneGroup is recommended for the first 1000cm and afterwards its not recommended anymore. Such a filling is not given in any input we receive so far.\n\nExpected Behavior:\n * Recommendation status changes should also happen within LaneGroups as described above.\n\nImpact:\n * Lane Recommendations are switching the status too late and guide the driver to wrong lanes.\n\nBug reporter:\n\nFlorian Perras",

After this, we observe that the ETA for the next stop-over is very unrealistic: it is showing an ETA of ~22:36. A more realistic ETA at that time is ~20:32.\n\nWe continue to follow the route. At 15:00, the ETA has increased to 23:44 at the next stop-over.\nImage: 1500ETA.jpg\nImage: 1500ChargePlan.jpg\n\nAccording to this, the route between the first and second charging stop would take almost 5 hours while covering 167km on the highway/autobahn. This is of-course completely unrealistic.\n\nThe issue remains apparent until at least 15:45, where the ETA increased up to 02:09 at the stop and 03:03. While doing so, we also deviated from the route (to drive Stuttgart - Karlsruhe - Mannheim instead of the suggested Stuttgart - Heilbronn - Mannheim), and we noticed that the arrival SoC at the CS in the route plan didn't change. At 15:45, our SoC was ~50% (46.25kWh), traveling 163km to the charger would make it impossible to arrive with 27% SoC.\n\nAdditionally, the routing didn't calculate a different alternative and kept routing us back to Stuttgart to take the Heilbronn - Mannheim route.\nImage: 1545ChargePlan.jpg\n\nRoute goes over Karlsruhe after many deviations at 15:57, with a much faster ETA at the first CS. The travel time between the first and second CS is still faulty.\nImage: 1557ChargePlan.jpg\n\nFrom 16:32 - 17:02, we charge at a CS earlier than suggested in the route planning. After leaving the CS. The route does not immediately get updated with the current SoC: the arrival SoC at the next CS in 27km is still set to 27% even tough we charged up to 80%. At 17:08, the new SoC suddenly gets in to the route. From this point onward, the ETA also drops massively.\u00a0Before the update the ETA was 3:31 at the first stop. After the update, the ETA was 20:57 (= 6hr34 faster).\u00a0\n\n[EXPECTATION]\nETA should always be realistic\nArrival SoC should be updating when the charge or route changes\nRoute should be updating to a more optimal path after multiple deviations.\n\n[HEALING]\nAt 17:08, the new SoC suddenly gets in to the route.

The yellow mark in Lane D shows where a lane merge is happening - we penalise this option since being in a merging lane is inconvenient for the driver. More importantly though, driving from E to X, if you change lanes before the yellow section you need to change lanes twice, whereas if you wait until after the yellow section you only need to change lanes once. So we prefer the second option. Whereas driving from D to V it makes sense to change before the yellow section, in order to perform three single-lane changes instead of changing multiple lanes at once. This leads to the recommended lanes highlighted in cyan, with a gap between them. This is why it\u2019s expected to have a gap in recommendations in some situations.\"",

The issue does only occur during map update when map is temporarily unavailable while POIs are being read from the map. The older DET4OTA SW will treat the MapUnavailable status as a fatal error. This means that in such case the POI map data producer will stop producing data until it is restarted. The POI map data producer is only restarted when Navigation is restarted, e.g., on the next bus-cycle. This behavior has recently been fixed on mainline under KPM 10224041. The new behavior for handling MapUnavailable status on mainline is to return an empty result. The POI map data producer will then continue running and return results as soon as the MapUnavailable status has been resolved, i.e., map is available again.",
