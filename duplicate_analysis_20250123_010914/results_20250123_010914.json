The nearby part of the route travels via Spottersweg and Eindhoven Airport, as it was possibly still considering some cached Perseus information (possibly avoiding the traffic delay on A2 South)\n\nRoute still looks unreachable as charge planning is still ongoing. \nSee: 1646_combustionRouteFinished_onboard.png\n\n[ACTION]\n\nWhile charge planning is still ongoing, we deviate from active non-EV route by entering A58 at 51.48403573181324, 5.3877128610310745. See 1646_enteredA58.png:\n\n16:47 CET: Charge planning is finished. See: 1647_chargePlanningFinished.png. We now have a route with 2 charge stops, 435km distance and ETA 22:01.\n\nShortly after, we enable toggle Privacy Switch back to ON such that online service connection gets restored.\n\n[OBSERVATION]\nOnline services are re-established, and about 1 minute after toggling ON the Privacy Vehicle Switch, the ETA gets updated such that arrival SoC becomes -60% instead of 10% and ETA drops. It looks like it falls back for a bit to the onboard calculated combustion route. See: 1649_routeTurnsIntoUnreachable.png\n\n[EXPECTATION]\nWhen online connection restores, the onboard planned EV route does not shortly revert back to an unreachable route that needs a BRP warning for \"unreachability\", this is misleading. Onboard route plan was OK to begin with.\n\n[HEALING]\nBRP shows up to activate the online planned better route. This route has ETA of 21:59 and 434km distance.

BE8, DRG (Dynamic Route Guidance) automatic, Alternatives off, EVTP (Electrical Vehicle Trip Planner) on (default), EV (Electric Vehicle) mocked through OBD2.\n\n**Observation:**  \nThe initial route was planned at 13:30. At ~14:29, the ETA for the next stop-over was showing ~22:36, while a more realistic ETA was ~20:32. By 15:00, the ETA increased to 23:44. The route between the first and second charging stop was unrealistic, taking almost 5 hours for 167km. The arrival SoC at the charging station did not change despite deviations from the route. At 15:45, the SoC was ~50%, making it impossible to arrive with 27% SoC. The routing did not calculate alternatives and kept directing back to Stuttgart. After charging at a CS (Charging Station) from 16:32 - 17:02, the route did not update the current SoC until 17:08, after which the ETA dropped significantly.\n\n**Expectation:**  \nETA should always be realistic. Arrival SoC should update when the charge or route changes. The route should update to a more optimal path after multiple deviations.\n\n**Healing:**  \nAt 17:08, the new SoC was incorporated into the route, resulting in a significant drop in ETA from 3:31 to 20:57 (6hr34 faster)."

The issue does only occur during map update when map is temporarily unavailable while POIs are being read from map. The older DET4OTA SW will treat the MapUnavailable status as a fatal error. This means that in such case the POI map data producer will stop producing data until it is restarted. The POI map data producer is only restarted when Navigation is restarted, e.g., on the next bus-cycle. This behavior has recently been fixed on mainline under KPM 10224041. The new behavior for handling MapUnavailable status on mainline is to return an empty result.

The yellow mark in Lane D shows where a lane merge is happening - we penalise this option since being in a merging lane is inconvenient for the driver. More importantly though, driving from E to X, if you change lanes before the yellow section you need to change lanes twice, whereas if you wait until after the yellow section you only need to change lanes once. So we prefer the second option. Whereas driving from D to V it makes sense to change before the yellow section, in order to perform three single-lane changes instead of changing multiple lanes at once. This leads to the recommended lanes highlighted in cyan, with a gap between them. This is why it\u2019s expected to have a gap in recommendations in some situations.\"",

After this, we observe that the ETA for the next stop-over is very unrealistic: it is showing an ETA of ~22:36. A more realistic ETA at that time is ~20:32.\n\nWe continue to follow the route. At 15:00, the ETA has increased to 23:44 at the next stop-over.\nImage: 1500ETA.jpg\nImage: 1500ChargePlan.jpg\n\nAccording to this, the route between the first and second charging stop would take almost 5 hours while covering 167km on the highway/autobahn. This is of-course completely unrealistic.\n\nThe issue remains apparent until at least 15:45, where the ETA increased up to 02:09 at the stop and 03:03. While doing so, we also deviated from the route (to drive Stuttgart - Karlsruhe - Mannheim instead of the suggested Stuttgart - Heilbronn - Mannheim), and we noticed that the arrival SoC at the CS in the route plan didn't change. At 15:45, our SoC was ~50% (46.25kWh), traveling 163km to the charger would make it impossible to arrive with 27% SoC.\n\nAdditionally, the routing didn't calculate a different alternative and kept routing us back to Stuttgart to take the Heilbronn - Mannheim route.\nImage: 1545ChargePlan.jpg\n\nRoute goes over Karlsruhe after many deviations at 15:57, with a much faster ETA at the first CS. The travel time between the first and second CS is still faulty.\nImage: 1557ChargePlan.jpg\n\nFrom 16:32 - 17:02, we charge at a CS earlier than suggested in the route planning. After leaving the CS. The route does not immediately get updated with the current SoC: the arrival SoC at the next CS in 27km is still set to 27% even tough we charged up to 80%. At 17:08, the new SoC suddenly gets in to the route. From this point onward, the ETA also drops massively.\u00a0Before the update the ETA was 3:31 at the first stop. After the update, the ETA was 20:57 (= 6hr34 faster).\u00a0\n\n[EXPECTATION]\nETA should always be realistic\nArrival SoC should be updating when the charge or route changes\nRoute should be updating to a more optimal path after multiple deviations.\n\n[HEALING]\nAt 17:08, the new SoC suddenly gets in to the route. From this point onward, the ETA also drops massively. Before the update the ETA was 3:31 at the first stop. After the update, the ETA was 20:57 (= 6hr34 faster).\u00a0\n\n[TIMESTAMP]\n14:29 - 17:08\n\n[NOTE]\nLogs for the relevant 2.5 hrs have been added to the ticket.\n\nFull logs can be found at https://etf.esolutions.de/user/?etf_id=6174568\n\nThe relevant parts on ETF are Part 1 and Part 2:\nPart 1: https://etf.esolutions.de/user/?etf_id=6174585 (13:27 - 16:33)\nPart 2: https://etf.esolutions.de/user/?etf_id=6174582 (16:53 - 17:15)\n\n[CONTACT]\nmatthijs.koot@tomtom.com\nmanjunath.kubasad@tomtom.com\nttdrivetesting",
